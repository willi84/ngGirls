# Mentors Prepareations

based on experience of Robert

## Important
* Respect the Code of Conduct
  * means: ngGirls is no dating platform, avoid sexists jokes or comments, every culture and religion is welcome => respect each other

## Goals
* most important goal of the workshop is empowerment
  * make your attendees happy and feel good of being a developer
  * share your experiences and learnings of your career path
  * offer help 

# Basics
* you learn together
  * you will get unexpected questions, have the challenge to describe stuff in a easy way, learn about yourself
  * show your attendee that you learn
* you don't always have to be there
  * at some point the attendees would also help each other
* show them the basic skills of a modern developer
  * helping, googling, asking, struggle & learn together
  * find togehter a solution
* not all attendees reach the final part
  * its ok, because they should learn, networking and having fun with development
  * provide help to finish the tutorial at home
* if they solved the tutorial let them go further with simple other tasks

# advises
* try to describe in the view of an unknown participanct
  * use easy pictures (e.g. every part of the body is a component)
* nod and smiling doesn't mean that they have understand it
  * sometime cultural issues prevent from asking
  * ask questions to check the understanding


# troubleshooting
* tutorial is not perfect
  * not everything is an instruction, sometimes its just for trying out
  * take care that they see the CLI commands page (will be sometimes overseen)
* pull requests are welcome
  * but its also good if not everything is perfect (helps struggeling)
* sometimes an restart of the CLI helps if nothing works
* on github you find the solution of the tutorial
* if its not possible to install the CLI on the laptop, just use stackblitz.com
